                        <li>Worryingly, marine pollution is reaching extreme levels, with over 17 million metric tons clogging the ocean in 2021, a figure set to double or triple by 2040. Plastic is the most harmful type of ocean pollution.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Currently, the ocean’s average pH is 8.1 which is about 30 per cent more acidic than in pre- industrial times. Ocean acidification threatens the survival of marine life, disrupts the food web, and undermines vital services provided by the ocean and our own food security.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Marine habitat destruction is on the rise. Our dependence on the marine environment and the pressure of human activity has grown significantly in recent years.  Over exploitation, pollution, increasing urbanisation in coastal regions, rising global populations and the spread of invasive species by our actions are threatening marine ecosystems and the services they provide.
                       </li>
                       <br>
                       <li>Over the years fishing methods have changed dramatically with new technology. Huge factory ships and trawlers means that fishing vessels can catch enormous quantities in one go.  These modern trawling methods do not differentiate between species and by-catch is devastating the numbers of fish in the ocean and wreaking havoc to the ocean floor. Over just 40 years there has been a decrease recorded in marine species of 39%.

                    <li>For open ocean and deep sea areas, sustainability can be achieved only through increased international cooperation to protect vulnerable habitats.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Establishing complete, effective and equitably managed systems of government-protected areas should be pursued to conserve biodiversity and ensure a sustainable future for the fishing industry.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>There are still many issues to address, but fortunately a growing awareness of the importance of the ‘Blue’ economy has resulted in recent developments in the design and implementation of marine resource management principles that offer a more integrated and holistic approach to planning and policy making that incorporates the complexities of the social, economic and environmental aspects of marine resource development.
                    </li>

                </li>
                <br>
                <li>With proper management, fish stocks can recover.  The Atlantic Bluefin Tuna was so in demand for the sushi and sashimi markets that it was spiralling towards extinction.  However, proper management techniques and a 15 year recovery plan have seen it bounce backs to a population that is sustainable.
                </li>
                <li>Above all, a way to support coral reef and seaweed recovery is necessary which is fulfilled by the AquaReLeaf product.
